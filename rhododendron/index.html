            <h2>AKA:</h2>
            <p1>Also known as the coast rhododendron, California Rhododendron, or simply bigleaf Rhododendron. (Even
                simpler, the Rhodie)</p1>

            <h2>HOW BIG?:</h2>
            <p1>Typical size is around 6 to 12 feet tall and 4 to 8 feet wide.
                In ideal wild conditions, it can reach up to 20 feet tall or even a bit more. Especially in shaded
                forest edges or old-growth coastal areas, where it has consistent moisture and rich soil</p1>

            <h2>WHERE IT GROWS:</h2>
            <p1>Native to the Pacific Coast of North America, the Pacific rhododendron ranges from British Columbia down
                through Washington and Oregon into northern California. It thrives in coastal forests, mountain slopes,
                and woodland clearings, often found between sea level and about 6,000 feet (1,800 m) in elevation.</p1>

            <h2>CLIMATE:</h2>
            <p1>Thrives in a cool, moist, and mild climate typical of the Pacific Northwest. It grows best in areas with
                wet winters, dry summers, and plenty of coastal fog or humidity, preferring temperate maritime or
                montane climates with well-drained, acidic soils.</p1>
