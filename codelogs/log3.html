    <h1>Code Log 3: CSS Media Queries</h1>

    <h2>How does a CSS media query work, and why is it useful?</h2>

    <p>
        Explanation:
        A CSS media query is used when you want your web content to adapt to different screen sizes or devices. It can
        apply specific styles
        only when certain conditions are met, like screen width, height, or orientation, so it helps you customiza. It
        works by checking the
        the user's device and then applying CSS styles that match those conditions. This is especially useful for
        creating responsive
        websites that look good and work well on desktops, tablets, and smartphones without needing separate versions of
        the site.
    </p>

    <h3>Media Features that are Supported by Media Queries and Examples:</h3>

    <p>
        Orientation - This can be used to apply styles based on whether a device is in portrait or landscape mode.
        Portrait meaning the height is greater than the width
        and landscape meaning vice versa. For Example applying the color lightblue specifically to landscape:
    </p>

    <textarea cols="100" rows="5">
    @media (orientation: landscape) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}
    </textarea>

    <p>
        Max Width - This can applies styles only when the screen width is less than or equal to a specified value.
        It's commonly used to make websites responsive by adjusting the layout for smaller screens like tablets and
        phones.
        Here's an example of the font size changing only when the screen is 600 pixels wide or less to a smaller
        readible size.
    </p>

    <textarea cols="100" rows="10">
   @media (max-width: 600px) {
  body {
    font-size: 14px;
  }
}
    </textarea>


    <p>
        Aspect Ratio - This one targets devices based on the ratio of width to height of the screen or viewport.
        It helps you apply styles depending on whether the screen is wide or tall in proportion, regardless of its
        actual size.
        Here's another example of applying it for a different background color only if the screen has a 16:9 aspect
        ratio.
        Itâ€™s useful when you want to optimize layouts for specific screen shapes, like widescreens or square displays.
    </p>

    <textarea cols="100" rows="5">
@media (aspect-ratio: 16/9) {
  body {
    background-color: lightgreen;
  }
}
     </textarea>

    <p>
        Pointer - This is used to detect the accuracy of the pointing device (like a mouse, stylus, or finger)
        available on the user's device. It helps you adjust the UI based on how precise the user can interact with
        elements.
        Here's an example where it increases button padding when the device has a coarse pointer, improving usability on
        touchscreens.
        Making buttons easier to tap on touch devices.
    </p>

    <textarea cols="100" rows="5">
   @media (pointer: coarse) {
  button {
    padding: 16px; 
  }
}
    </textarea>
