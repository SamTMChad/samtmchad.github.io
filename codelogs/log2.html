    <p>What are the differences between absolute and relative CSS length units?</p>

    <textarea cols="100" rows="9">
    Explanation:
    There is one key difference between absolute and relative measurement units in CSS, and it lies in how they relate to other elements or the overall design context. 
    Absolute measurement units refer to fixed values that do not change regardless of screen size, resolution, or the surrounding content. 
    Because of their precision and predictability, absolute units are commonly used when exact measurements are required. Like when designing print or elements 
    that must maintain stricter proportions across various environments.
    On the other hand, relative measurement units are dynamic and depend on other factors such as the parent elements size or the root font size of the document.
    Relative units are ideal for creating responsive designs that adapt to different devices and screen sizes, making them essential in modern web development.
    They provide flexibility, allowing designers to create layouts that scale naturally and maintain usability across a range of display settings.

    Relative measurment examples - px, pt (Pixels and Points): The px unit stands for pixels, and is a very popular unit. In CSS, a pixel is defined as a fixed length 
    that should appear consistent across devices, based on a reference pixel. According to standard, 1px is defined as 1/96th of 1 inch
    The pt unit stands for points, a traditional unit from print design. In CSS, one point is 1/72 of an inch. This comes from the world of typography and printing.

    Absolute measurement example #1 - em, rem: The em unit is a relative unit that is based on the computed font size of the parent element.
    For example, if the parent element has a font-size of 16px, then 1em equals 16px. If you set an element’s font-size: 2em;, it will be 2 × 16px = 32px
    It is primarily and commonly used for scaling font sizes. The rem unit stands for “root em”, and it's based on the font size of the root element (<html>), 
    not the parent element.
    This makes it more predictable and easier to manage than em.

    Absolute measurement example #2 - vw, vh: vh stands for viewport height, where 1vh is equal to 1% of the height of the the browser window (visible viewport).
    Like for example, if the viewport height is 1000px, then 1vh = 10px. 100vh would fill the entire visible height of the browser window. Its useful for when 
    you want to create full-screen sections of a page. vw stands for viewport width, where 1vw is equal to 1% of the width of the visible viewport. This means 
    that the two in tandem work together as width and height measurements.
