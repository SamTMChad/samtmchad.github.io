    <h2>How Images Are Used in HTML and CSS</h2>

    <p>
        Images can be added to a webpage using HTML elements or through CSS styling. In HTML, images are placed directly
        into the page using the &lt;img&gt; tag. In CSS, images are commonly added as background images using the
        background-image property. Both methods are important for web design, but they serve different purposes in how
        images behave, scale, and interact with content.
    </p>

    <h3>Difference Between &lt;img&gt; and background-image</h3>

    <p>
        The &lt;img&gt; tag is used to place an image directly into the content of a webpage. It is part of the HTML
        structure and can include alt text for accessibility and SEO. A background image is applied through CSS and is
        mostly decorative. It does not appear in the page content and cannot include alternative text for screen
        readers. Images added using &lt;img&gt; affect the layout directly, while background images stay behind other
        elements and are used mainly for design purposes.

<img src="photo.jpg" alt="A photo of a mountain" width="300">
    </textarea>

    <textarea cols="100" rows="8">
/* CSS Background Image */
.box {
  background-image: url("photo.jpg");
  width: 300px;
  height: 200px;
}
    </textarea>

    <h3>Other CSS Properties That Affect Background Images</h3>

    <p>
        Besides background-image, several other CSS properties control how background images appear.
        The background-size property controls how large the background image appears, such as "cover" or "contain."
        The background-position property controls where the image is placed within the element, such as center, top, or
        bottom.
        The background-repeat property controls whether the image repeats or only appears once.

.box {
  background-image: url("photo.jpg");
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
  background-repeat: no-repeat;
}
    </textarea>

    <h3>Dimensions vs Resolution (One-Sentence Definition)</h3>

    <p>
        Dimensions refer to the width and height of an image in pixels, while resolution refers to how detailed the
        image is based on pixel density.
    </p>

    <h3>Extra Credit: Image File Formats</h3>

    <p>
        GIF, PNG, JPG/JPEG, WebP, and SVG are all common image formats used on the web, but they are designed for
        different purposes.
        GIF supports simple animations and has limited colors, which makes it good for small animated graphics.
        PNG supports transparency and high image quality, making it great for logos and graphics with sharp edges.
        JPG/JPEG compresses images very efficiently, making it ideal for photographs but it does not support
        transparency.
        WebP is a modern format that supports both transparency and compression, often producing smaller file sizes
        than JPG and PNG.
        SVG is a vector format, meaning it is made of mathematical paths instead of pixels, allowing it to scale
        perfectly at any size without losing quality.
