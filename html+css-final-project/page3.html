            <p>
                Brockhampton were an American[c] hip-hop group founded in San Marcos, Texas in 2014. Formed partially
                through online forums, the group was often noted for their size, diversity, and prolific discography.
                The group's final line-up included vocalists Kevin Abstract, Matt Champion, Merlyn Wood, and Dom
                McLennon, producers/vocalists Russell "JOBA" Boring, Ciarán "bearface" McDonald and Jabari Manwa,
                producers Romil Hemnani and Kiko Merley, graphic designer Henock "HK" Sileshi, photographer Ashlan Grey,
                web designer Roberto Ontenient, and manager Jon Nunes.

                Founded by de facto leader Kevin Abstract in 2014, Brockhampton consisted of members of the defunct
                Internet music collective AliveSinceForever. Their debut mixtape, All-American Trash, was independently
                released in 2016. After relocating to Los Angeles, the group achieved critical and commercial success
                with their studio albums Saturation, Saturation II, Saturation III, which were released in quick
                succession over six months in 2017. The next year, they signed to RCA Records, and shortly afterwards
                founding member Ameer Vann was removed from the group following accusations of sexual misconduct. After
                repeated delays, Iridescence (2018) debuted atop the Billboard 200 and earned the group a nomination at
                the Brit Awards. Ginger (2019) and Roadrunner: New Light, New Machine (2021) were released to similar
                commercial success, with the former producing the multi-platinum single "Sugar". In 2022, the group
                disbanded following the release of their final studio albums The Family and TM.
