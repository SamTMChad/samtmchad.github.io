			<h3>Description:</h3>
			<p>The cookies are rooted in classic Toll House flavor, but browning the butter amps up the toasty notes
				and
				is key in developing the balance of crisp edges, while a high ratio of brown sugar to white sugar
				ensures chewy chocolate chip cookie centers.  </p>

			<h3>Ingredients:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li>1½ cups plus 1 Tbsp. (200 g) all-purpose flour </li>
				<li>1¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt</li>
				<li>¾ tsp. (4 g) baking soda</li>
				<li>¾ cup (1½ sticks; 169 g) unsalted butter, divided</li>
				<li>1 cup (200 g) (packed) dark brown sugar</li>
				<li>¼ cup (50 g) granulated sugar</li>
				<li>1 large egg</li>
				<li>2 large egg yolks</li>
				<li>2 tsp. vanilla extract</li>
				<li>6 oz. (170 g) bittersweet chocolate (60%–70% cacao), coarsely chopped, or semisweet chocolate
					chips
				</li>
			</ul>

			<h3>Directions:</h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Place racks in upper and lower thirds of oven; preheat to 375°. Whisk 1½ cups plus 1 Tbsp. (200
					g)
					all-purpose flour, 1¼ tsp. (4 g) Diamond Crystal or ¾ tsp. (4 g) Morton kosher salt, and ¾ tsp.
					(4
					g) baking soda in a small bowl; set flour mixture aside.
				</li>
				<li>Cook ½ cup (1 stick; 113 g) unsalted butter in a large saucepan over medium heat, swirling often
					and
					scraping bottom of pan with a heatproof rubber spatula, until butter foams, then browns, about 4
					minutes. Scrape melted butter and any brown bits to a large heatproof mixing bowl and let cool 1
					minute. Cut remaining ¼ cup (½ stick; 56 g) unsalted butter into small pieces and add to brown
					butter (it should start to melt but not foam and sizzle, so test with one piece before adding
					the
					rest).</li>
				<li>Once butter is melted, add 1 cup (200 g) (packed) dark brown sugar and ¼ cup (50 g) granulated
					sugar
					and whisk, breaking up any clumps, until sugar is incorporated and no lumps remain. Add 1 large
					egg
					and 2 large egg yolks and whisk until sugar dissolves and mixture is smooth, about 30 seconds.
					Whisk
					in 2 tsp. vanilla extract. Using rubber spatula, fold reserved dry ingredients into butter
					mixture
					just until no dry spots remain, then fold in 6 oz. (170 g) bittersweet chocolate (60%–70%
					cacao),
					coarsely chopped, or semisweet chocolate chips (the cookie dough will be soft but should hold
					its
					shape once scooped; if it slumps or oozes after being scooped, stir dough back together several
					times and let rest 5–10 minutes until scoops hold their shape as the flour hydrates).</li>
				<li>Using a 1½-oz. scoop (3 Tbsp.), portion out 16 balls of dough and divide between 2
					parchment-paper-lined rimmed baking sheets. Bake cookies, rotating sheets if cookies are
					browning
					very unevenly (otherwise, just leave them alone), until deep golden brown and firm around the
					edges,
					8–10 minutes. Let cool on baking sheets.
				</li>
			</ol>
